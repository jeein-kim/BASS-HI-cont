## The L-band continuum images of 40 **BASS-HI** targets

These datasets were obtained from two projects (_VLA/20A-123_ and _VLA/23B-079_) observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).  
The observations were conducted in the C- and D-configurations, targeting 38 and 2 sources, respectively.  
The L-band broadband covers 1–2 GHz, resulting in a typical bandwidth of 1 GHz.  
The data were processed and reduced using _CASA 6.5.4-9 CASAtools:v1.0.0_.  

The measurement files include BAT IDs, beam information, measured fluxes with uncertainties, measured radii, and RMS values.  
RMS values were derived from the imaging residual FITS files.




#### 20A-123 (C-configuration) PI: A.Chung
A total of 38 datasets are included.  
The average beam size is ~12–16 arcsec.  
The mean RMS is 64.4 ± 70 μJy/beam.  
For 31 datasets with RMS < 100 μJy/beam, the mean RMS is 39.65 ± 23.79 μJy/beam.  
For 7 datasets with RMS > 100 μJy/beam, the mean RMS is 173.98 ± 104.65 μJy/beam.  

#### 23B-079 (D-configuration) PI: J.Kim
A total of 2 datasets are included.  
The average beam size is ~30–40 arcsec.  
The mean RMS is 20 μJy/beam.
